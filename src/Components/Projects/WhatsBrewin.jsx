          What's Brewin' a centralized platform to discover new breweries. We
          love beer and travel and wanted to give back to the breweries in all
          areas giving them a space to be easily discovered. This is our final
          project for Web Development Program at Lighthouse Labs made possible
          with the help of -
          <a href="https://www.openbrewerydb.org/" target="_blank">
            Open Brewery DB
          </a>
          .
