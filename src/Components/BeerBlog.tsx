        I would cringe at every time someone told me that a blog helps you stand
        out in the tech world. So in the midst of a career change and being in a
        world of new and uncomfortable territory, I thought what better time to

        sounding like a moron trying to talk smart on something I know I
        shouldn't be giving advice on yet.

        Here I will be sharing homebrew recipes, most of which will be ones that
        were on tap at Herald Street. I will also cover some some key concepts
        for beginners along with tips and how-tos for growing up our own
        cultures.
